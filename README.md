## Installation

Clone the repository to your machine in a new Github repo. Copy all the files and get crackin!

## Usage

This page can be used to schedule out a typical 9-5 workday. The time-slot boxes have a text input ability that allows you to track tasks in those time slots. Those notes or tasks will be saved by local storage and reloaded until they are changed by the user. 

The display also updates the color scheme of the day based off the current time to show hour of highest importance.
